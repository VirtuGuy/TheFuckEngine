# Assets

This is a nice little guide on good asset creation.

## Images

One thing you probably don't want the engine to have is images that could be smaller in size. The art folder includes a bat file that can optimize every png in the assets folder. You need [oxipng](https://github.com/oxipng/oxipng) in order to run the file.

## Audio

Nothing yet lol

## Format

For consistency, the assets folder should have its files in a lower kebab case format (ex. `my-super-cool-song`).
